# README

## Description:
This R script is designed to analyze the results of a study on the leak of job opportunities for fresh graduated engineers. The analysis encompasses preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing on data derived from interviews, statements, and surveys conducted as part of the study. The script aims to extract insights into factors influencing the job opportunities leak and provide actionable recommendations.

## Requirements:
- R environment
- Required R packages:
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - tidytext
  - tm
  - wordcloud
  - SnowballC
  - topicmodels
  - scales
  - stringr
  - ggrepel
  - RColorBrewer

Ensure the required packages are installed by running:
```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidytext", "tm", "wordcloud", "SnowballC", "topicmodels", "scales", "stringr", "ggrepel", "RColorBrewer"))
```

## Usage:
1. Place the dataset file (`interview_data.csv`, `statements_data.csv`, `survey_data.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Execute the R script in an R environment.
3. The script will load the necessary libraries, import the dataset, preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, conduct statistical tests, and generate visualizations.
4. Review the outputs in the R console and any generated plots or tables.

## Steps Covered:
1. Data Import and Preprocessing:
   - Import dataset from interviews, statements, and surveys
   - Text preprocessing: tokenization, removal of stopwords, stemming
   - Data cleaning: handling missing values, formatting issues

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Word frequency analysis
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
   - Visualization of word clouds, sentiment distributions, and topic distributions

3. Hypothesis Testing:
   - Statistical tests to examine associations between variables (e.g., job opportunities leak and factors identified in the study)
   - ANOVA, chi-square tests, or regression analysis depending on the nature of variables

4. Additional Analysis:
   - Identification of key themes and patterns from qualitative data
   - Visualization of findings using bar charts, scatter plots, and thematic maps
   - Comparison of results across different data sources (interviews, statements, surveys)

## Output:
- Word frequency tables
- Sentiment analysis results (positive/negative sentiment scores)
- Topic modeling results (identified topics and associated keywords)
- Visualizations (word clouds, sentiment distributions, topic distributions)
- Statistical test results (p-values, test statistics)
- Interpretation of findings and actionable recommendations

## Note:
- Customize the script to suit the specific structure and characteristics of your dataset.
- Ensure that the preprocessing steps adequately handle text data from interviews, statements, and surveys.
- Interpret the results within the context of the job opportunities leak study and consider implications for policy or intervention strategies.
- Extend the analysis as needed based on additional data sources or research questions.
